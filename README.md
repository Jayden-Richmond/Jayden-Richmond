## Hello!

My name is Jayden Richmond! I am a computer science student at Dalton State, but I plan to transfer later to a larger tech school to finish my degree. I currently work at Shaw Industries as a robotics intern.

- I'm working on a Discord bot designed for our computer science club to automatically give weekly challenges to the members. I'm also planning to send new members the resources they need to complete.
- I'm currently learning Python and some cybersecurity courses online to identify vulnerabilities in code. I'll be honest and say I know very little compared to most people in the field, but I am eager to learn all I can.
- I am willing to collaborate on simple projects to become more experienced in the field.
- If you have any learning resources, let me know!
